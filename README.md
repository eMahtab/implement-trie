# Trie Implementation
## https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree

Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.

```
Example:

Trie trie = new Trie();

trie.insert("apple");
trie.search("apple");   // returns true
trie.search("app");     // returns false
trie.startsWith("app"); // returns true
trie.insert("app");   
trie.search("app");     // returns true
```

**Note:**
1. You may assume that all inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
2. All inputs are guaranteed to be non-empty strings.


## Approach :
So we have to implement trie with `insert()`, `search()` and `startsWith()` functionalities. We are given that the, input consists of only lowercase letters `a-z` so each `TrieNode` can have at most 26 children (not more than that). So we will have two properties in the `TrieNode` class, an array of `TrieNode` called children and a boolean `isEnd` (which tells whether this TrieNode marks the end of a word)

```java
public class TrieNode {
	TrieNode[] children;
	boolean isEnd;

	public TrieNode() {
		this.children = new TrieNode[26];
	}
}
```
Now lets define the `Trie` class, below is the skeleton of the `Trie` class. Trie class hold the TrieNode which refers to the root of the Trie.

Note that Trie will be instantiated as `Trie trie = new Trie()` from outside, so initially all 26 entries in children array will be null for root node, which means initially there won't be any children in `Trie` but just a `TrieNode` root. 

```java
public class Trie {
    private TrieNode root;
    
    public Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    public void insert(String word) {
       
    }
   
    public boolean search(String word) {
       
    }

    public boolean startsWith(String prefix) {
       
    }
}
```

### Implementing insert(String) 
`insert()` method takes a String `word` and doesn't return anything. We start from the root node and iterate over all the characters of the `word`. 

We check if the node's children array already have that character, if it does, we set our next node to that children `TrieNode`, otherwise we create a new `TrieNode` and set it to the node's children array and also set the next node to that newly created `TrieNode`

And at the end after itrating over all the characters of the input word, we set the node's `isEnd` property to true, since that node marks the end of the word in the `Trie`.


```java
public void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++){
            char ch = word.charAt(i);
            int index = ch - 'a';
            if(node.children[index] == null){
                TrieNode temp = new TrieNode();
                node.children[index]=temp;
                node = temp;
            } else {
            	node = node.children[index];
            }
        }
        node.isEnd=true;
}
```

Note how we are checking if the `TrieNode` have a children with the same character. We are not compairing against actual character, rather we are checking, is the index pointed by that character is null or not. If its null we know that `TrieNode` doesn't have a children with the same character, otherwise if its not null then we are sure that `TrieNode` have a children with the same character.
